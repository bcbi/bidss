# Electronic Health Records

\toc

#### Introduction

~~~ 
<div class="home-box">
    “The <b>Electronic Health Record (EHR)</b> is a longitudinal electronic record of patient health information generated by <b>one or more encounters in any care delivery setting. </b>
Included in this information are <b>patient demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports.</b>
The EHR <b>automates and streamlines the clinician's workflow.</b>
The EHR has the ability to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter - as well as supporting other care-related activities directly or indirectly via interface - including <b>evidence-based decision support, quality management, and outcomes reporting.</b>”

#### Challenges

~~~ 
<div class="home-box">
    "Research with EHR presents several challenges that should be considered: 
    - Obtaining data
      - Access to <b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</b> is tightly regulated by federal law, industry standard, and institutional policy.
      - Synthetic datasets such as [MIMIC-IV](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/) can be accessed more readily.
    - Bias in data
      - Data may be gathered with an original purpose other than research or scientific discovery:
        - Billing
        - Documentation
        - Patient management
        - Preparation of legal documents
        - Use by health care personnel
      - Research-relevant data might not be collected.
      - Patients might be excluded based on difficulty of measurement.
      - There may be High missing rates, possibly correlated to condition.
    - Considerations for assessing data quality
      - Attribute domain constraints (e.g., Are any negative pulse oximetry values present?)
      - Relational integrity rules (e.g., Could there be multiple primary keys for a patient?)
      - Historical data rules (e.g., Is the same format used over time?)
      - State-dependent rules (e.g., Do records exists after time of death?)
      - Attribute dependency rules (e.g., Is pregnancy in males observed?)
Much of the effort spent in an EHR study involves preparing the data for use."
