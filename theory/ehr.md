# Electronic Health Records

\toc

#### Introduction

~~~ 
<div class="home-box">
    “The <b>Electronic Health Record (EHR)</b> is a longitudinal electronic record of patient health information generated by <b>one or more encounters in any care delivery setting. </b>
Included in this information are <b>patient demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data and radiology reports.</b>
The EHR <b>automates and streamlines the clinician's workflow.</b>
The EHR has the ability to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter - as well as supporting other care-related activities directly or indirectly via interface - including <b>evidence-based decision support, quality management, and outcomes reporting.</b>”

#### Challenges

~~~ 
<div class="home-box">
Research with EHR presents several challenges that should be considered: 
<ul>
    <li> Obtaining data
<ul>
      <li> Access to <b>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</b> is tightly regulated by federal law, industry standard, and institutional policy.
      <li> Synthetic datasets such as <a href="https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.0/">MIMIC-IV</a> have fewer restrictions on acccess.
</ul>
    <li> Bias in data
<ul>
      <li> Data may be gathered with an original purpose other than research or scientific discovery:
<ul>
        <li> Billing
        <li> Documentation
        <li> Patient management
        <li> Preparation of legal documents
        <li> Use by health care personnel
</ul>
      <li> Research-relevant data might not be collected.
      <li> Patients might be excluded based on difficulty of measurement.
      <li> There may be High missing rates, possibly correlated to condition.
</ul>
    <li> Considerations for assessing data quality
<ul>
      <li> Attribute domain constraints (Are any negative pulse oximetry values present?)
      <li> Relational integrity rules (Could there be multiple primary keys for a patient?)
      <li> Historical data rules (Is the same format used over time?)
      <li> State-dependent rules (Do records exists after time of death?)
      <li> Attribute dependency rules (Is pregnancy in males observed?)
</ul>
</ul>
Much of the effort spent in an EHR study involves preparing the data for use.
