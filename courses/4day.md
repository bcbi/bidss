# Gateways Data Science Skills Short Course: Four-Day Short Course

\toc

## Description

* Modern health care relies on the ability to best interpret available data that may originate from a number of sources, including healthcare professionals, patients, and medical devices. **_Biomedical informatics_** as a discipline is broadly concerned with the effective use of data, information, and knowledge to improve human health. **_Data science_** is the process of interpreting data for use within specific contexts.
* This **_intensive four-day short course_** for gateways students will include discussions and hands-on experiences for introducing data science concepts and the field of biomedical informatics. Participants will be taught foundational computing skills for exploring and analyzing electronic health data, including working at the Linux command line and writing computer programs using the Julia general-purpose programming language. The knowledge and skills obtained will prepare participants for more advanced modules and learning activities offered throughout the year (e.g., databases, machine learning, and natural language processing).
